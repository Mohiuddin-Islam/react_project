      " Front-wheel drive is preferred by drivers who want to keep their fuel consumption at a minimum. Rear-wheel drive is preferred by performance enthusiasts and truck buyers—both of whom need as much torque as possible. Improved quality of life: Being able to drive can make it easier to participate in activities and social events, visit family and friends, and run errands. Safety: In some cases, driving can be safer than using public transportation, especially if you are traveling alone or at night.",

      " The simplest way to bring your vehicle back to life is to jump-start the battery. This involves either sharing the electrical power from another automobile through jumper cables or using a portable jump pack to help give you enough juice to start your vehicle. The portable jump-starter solution is sometimes the easiest. Most have electrical leads you need to attach to the dead battery, which will provide enough spark to restart your car. Some, but not all, are able to supply power to completely discharged batteries. Most require some voltage to operate, even if that’s not enough to start the car.",

      " The smart way to give a trip is the no-surprise method where you and the recipient collaborate on where to go and when; then, you act as the travel agent by putting it all together. Don't worry, it's not hard. One of the challenges with giving an trip as a gift is making it fun to actually open. Especially on holiday with big expectations, like Christmas morning, you want your kids to be over the moon about their presents, not confused why they only got this piece of paper saying they’re headed out of town.",
